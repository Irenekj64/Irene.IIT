<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Name: Irene Kappiliparampil Jacob</dt>
  <dt>Student Number: s3902435</dt>
  <dt>Student Email Address:s3902435@student.rmit.edu.au</dt>
  <dt>Background Info:</dt>
  <dd>- I was born in Kerala, India, and moved to New Zealand when I was 3. I lived in New Zealand for 14 years and
  moved to Australia in 2019. I graduated from Highschool last year and am in my first year of the Bachelor of IT
  at RMIT. I speak English and Malayalam fluently but I am also in the process of learning French.</dd>
  <dd>- Some of my hobbies are reading , dancing and playing badminton</dd>
</dl>


<h2> Interest in IT</h2>

<p> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that
 sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>

<p>One particular event that sparked my interest in IT was the very first time my dad bought a laptop. As someone who
had never seen a laptop before, I was fascinated by how much the laptop facilitated simple, everyday tasks,
such as searching up information, sending messages and emails, and watching movies or shows. This general interest in computing and technology lead me to take up VCE Computing in Year 11, where I had the opportunity to
learn more about Computers and computing software. I also gained a particular interest in Cybersecurity, and specifically in how it can be used to prevent cybercrime. </p>
</p>

<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT because of the reputation it has in producing experienced, industry-ready IT graduates.
Additionally, I viewed the opportunity to specialize in certain areas of IT, such as security and cloud computing,
as beneficial in increasing my skills in a cybersecurity related field . Furthermore, since the RMIT campus is
conveniently based in the heart of Melbourne, it further enables me to balance my social and academic life. </p>

<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<p/>
<p>During my studies I expect to learn more about the Information Technology industry, as well as gain industry-relevant
experience and understanding of a wide range of IT subjects. Moreover, I hope that this degree will allow me to
consolidate my decision to pursue a career in cybersecurity, or even lead me to find an inclination towards other
specialisations. </p>

<p>The results of one further online test of your choosing:</p>
<img src=file:///C:/Users/jacob/OneDrive/Desktop/Big%20Five%20Personality%20Test.png alt=BigFivePersonalityTest>
<p>O = Openness, C = Conscientiousness, E= Extraversion, A= Agreeableness, N= Neuroticism</p>


<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>

<p>The 16 personalities test results show that I am a mediator, or INFP-T. These results are not very surprising for me since I have always considered myself slightly introverted, yet willing to  take myself out of my comfort zone when necessary. I have also thought myself to be empathetic, as I often care deeply about the people around me. Furthermore, I acknowledge that I tend to be governed by emotions at times, as according to the “Feeling” trait, but I usually attempt to make most of my decisions rationally. Moreover, The 16 Personalities Test has claimed that I am 67% Prospecting, meaning I have a flexibility when dealing with unexpected challenges, which I agree with.   However it is slightly surprising for me that I am considered turbulent, as I had not regarded myself to be overly perfectionistic or self critical. The results of the learning style test were interesting to me, as it provided me with an insight into how I could better make use of my study time, namely through visualizing the things that I want to memorize.  Additionally, I do not completely agree with the results of the Big Five Personality Test as although I consider myself to somewhat agreeable, and not at all neurotic or extraverted, I do not have the tendency to be quite open or transparent, and do not regard myself to be lacking in conscientiousness, as I usually try to be as efficient as possible when aiming to achieve a set goal.
</p>

<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>

<p>The results of the 16 personalities test, which state that I am a “Mediator” or INFP-T, may have an effect on my behaviour in a team as my slight introvertedness might prove to be a challenge for me to communicate clearly and efficiently with others on my team. When forming a team I would take this into account by involving extroverted team members in my team, who would have the ability to offset my introversion. Furthermore I am confident that I could utilize my intuition and feeling to effectively connect with my team members, which would in turn allow me to communicate better with them. Additionally, the intuition might be useful in determining the dynamics within the team, and ensuring that no conflicts occur between team members. According to the “Turbulent” trait, I may have the tendency to be self-critical, which could decrease my confidence in my abilities while working with a team, and lead me to be less motivated to accomplish team goals, thus also be detrimental to the team. In order to counteract this, I could form a team who show empathy and collaborate together to achieve goals, as well as celebrate their successes. The results of the learning-style test would not have much of an influence on my behaviour in a team, except in that I may turn to more visual and perceptible ways to communicate with the team (such as through power-points or videos). When forming a team I could take this into account by involving a mix of audio and kinaesthetic learners as well in the team, so that the team’s creativity and overall productivity would be increased. According to the Big Five Personality test, my lack of conscientiousness may be problematic in terms of achieving team goals, however by forming a supportive and non-critical team, this would soon cease to be a problem.

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<p>Overview:</p>
<p>This project will be a safety app designed to keep primarily women, but also other users, safe as they are walking alone or by themselves, such as at night time. This app, called Guardx would contain a number of features that can provide help and aid to individuals who are in danger, by immediately connecting them with close contacts or emergency services with the press of a button or through voice activation. In turn, this app aims to provide these individuals and their families with an assurance about their safety and protection.
</p>

<p>Motivation:</p>
<p>There have been countless stories of women who have been attacked while walking by themselves at night, alone and vulnerable. Due to this, many women, including myself, have been warned time and time again not to go out alone at night, advice which, against our own will, we women have been following for decades. Just recently the world was shocked by the news of Sarah Everard, a young women who was murdered by a man, allegedly a police officer, while walking home by herself. Additionally, The Mission Australia Gender Gaps 2018 Youth Survey found that “46.6 per cent of women aged between 15 and 19 years old felt “unsafe” or “very unsafe” when walking alone in their community after dark”. – SBS NEWS(cite)
  As women are now finding fewer and fewer ways to stay safe while alone, I think that it is increasingly important that technology be used to find alternative ways to help keep women safe. Guardx is one such solution, designed to be easy accessible to thousands of women around the world.
</p>

<p> Description:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>This app might include a range of features, such as a:</dt>
  <dd>-	GPS tracker: The Global Positioning System can be used to share the individual’s position with close contacts, which also allows them to know the exact location of the user to send emergency help or aid if the individual encounters any danger.</dd>
  <dd>-	Google Maps: This app would also integrate the web mapping-service of Google maps, providing users with an idea of the fastest and safest route they can take to reach their destination. If possible, this map may also depict nearby police-stations or phone booths, in case of any emergency.</dd>
  <dd>-	Voice Activation: Certain features of this app, such as an alert to close contacts and immediate livestreaming of video, can be activated through the user shouting “Help” 2 times, or a word of their choosing atleast once. The user’s voice will be recorded prior to their use of the app to create their unique voice print, so that only the user can activate these features with their voice. The app will also automatically lock the phone during voice activation, so that any attacker will not be able to turn livestreaming or location sharing off. Only the user will be able to unlock the app afterwards through the use of a special pin or password.</dd>
  <dd>-	Emergency Contacts: The user is also able to choose a list of emergency contacts who can track their location, and who can be placed on speed dial for easy access. These emergency contacts will also receive simultaneous text and calling alerts if the user is in danger, and who will also able to view the livestream if it is activated.</dd>
  <dd>Real time streaming: Through this app users also have the ability to livestream their situation, to both their emergency contacts and social media app of their own choosing. (If users do not want their livestream to be posted on a social media app, they can change this setting). The video recorded during livestreaming also has the potential to be used as evidence after the incident has occurred. The recorded video would also be uploaded to an off-site server in the case that the phone is destroyed or lost. This livestreaming option will be made instantly accessible to users with the touch of a button. For example, livestreaming can be turned on by voice activation, or by pressing on the home button (or equivalent) twice. Additionally, the app would record with both the front and back cameras during livestreaming, to increase the chance that any incident will be filmed. During livestreaming, the phone screen would also be blackened so that any attackers would not be aware of the livestream, and as soon as the livestream begins the app will automatically lock, so that only the user will be able to switch livestreaming off again.
  </dd>
  <dd>-	Emergency Services: the App would also provide a shortcut on the home screen to access or call emergency services, such as police, fire, or ambulance.</dd>

</dl>


 <p>Tools and Technologies:</p>
 <dl>
   <dt>Some hardware that would be needed involve:</dt>
   <dd>- A Guardx server, to which livestreamed videos can be uploaded offsite</dd>
   <dd>- A smartphone, as the Guardx app would be primarily designed for android and ios phones. However it may have the potential to be used on smartwatches and tablets as well with some alterations.</dd>
   <dd>- GPS receiver inside the phone which would receive radio waves from satellites to track location.</dd>
   <dd>- Front and Back Cameras, that record the video required for the livestream</dd>
   <dd>- Microphones: which will receive the sound required for voice activation, as well as record the sounds from the livestream</dd>
   <dt>The software required for this app include:</dt>
   <dd>-	GPS software</dd>
   <dd>-	Google Maps SDK, an open source software that can be used to integrate Google Maps into the Guardx app, as well as provide additional information for the map.</dd>
   <dd>-	Mobile operating system (such as Android or iOS)</dd>
   <dd>-	Camera app: to record live video</dd>
   <dd>-	Voice recognition software:to decode the user’s voice and use it to activate a number of features, such as alerts and videostreaming</dd>
</dl>

 <p>Skills Required:</p>
<p>Some skills that may be required for this project would include the ability to build a highly functioning user interface design, as it is incredibly important for this safety app to be easily accessed by users. Some other skills that may be required might involve programming, with experience in languages like C++ and Java, as well as Application Programming Interfaces such as Apple iOS and Android. Additionally, another skill may be database management, which is important to ensure that the data obtained from users, such as their livestreamed videos and locations (if given permission), will be kept safe. This also involves ensuring the app is secure, through the use of techniques such as encryption and security testing.	It is not at all difficult to find the skills required for this project, such as programming and User Interface Design, or even certain software, such as Google Maps SDK. However it is expected that this project will require quite a lot of resources, such as time and money, on order to acquire the necessary skills, software and hardware that are needed. Thus this project would not personally be very feasible to me, since I do not own the necessary resources.
</p>

<p>Outcome:</p>
<p>If the project is successful, some of the outcomes would be individuals, and especially women, personally feeling a lot safer when going around by themselves, as they will have a guarantee that help or aid is near at hand if they are ever in trouble. The original problem, of women being in danger in the first place, will not entirely be solved unless society finally decides to protect its’ women. However the development of this project will have the impact of women, and other vulnerable individuals, being less afraid or worried about travelling alone, so that they can regain some control over their own lifestyle. Though such an app shouldn’t have to exist, it is instrumental in ensuring the safety and security of women around the world.
